        <div class= "language"> HTML, CSS, Adobe XD </div>
        <div class= "description"> AZ Lyrics is an old website which provides
          its users lyrics to many<br> songs.
          However, the website’s UI/UX seems to be pretty<br> standard and plain HTML.
          Using Adobe XD, my group and I<br> were able to
          make high-fidelity prototypes to redesign four of its<br> pages.
          Implementing theories on color, typography and<br> spacing,
          we were able to redesign the pages that provides<br> better visuals.

      <div class= "language"> Sketch, Swift, XCode </div>
      <div class= "description"> Thrifty is a custom iOS application that
        can track a user’s<br> expenses. Using Sketch, my partner and I created a prototype
        of<br> the flow and UX/UI of the app. The prototype was translated<br> using Xcode’s storyboard
        for UI and Swift for its functionalities.

      <div class= "description"> Using Python, we created a visualization of
        restaurant ratings <br> using machine learning, a growing field at the intersection
        of <br> computer science and statistics that analyzes data to find<br>
        patterns and make predictions, and the Yelp Academic Dataset.<br> The scope of the
        dataset is within the Berkeley, California region.

      create and design<br> a replica of the famous multimedia messaging app,
      Snapchat that<br> allows users to take photos and send it to their friends.<br>
      This project used Firebase, a mobile and web<br> app development platform
      as its local database for<br> storing user's information. In addition, this
      project<br> used both programmatic and UI/UX design.

  <div class= "description">The goal of the project is to create and
    design a<br> replica of a famous game called Hangman.
    Using <br>the Model-View-Controller framework, Swift and
    XCode, I<br> was able to design the User Interface of
    the iOS game<br>, implement functions that will
    generate a random <br>phrase, provide the progress of the user
    by updating the <br>"hangman" and the letters that were guessed,
    and many more <br>that will allow you to either in or lose the game.
